## Summary

Add dual incentives to SAYVE<>UST pool on Astroport($SAYVE & $ASTRO token emissions). The purpose of this proposal is to receive feedback from the community about this idea and gather thoughts regarding the rewards before putting up a poll.**

## Abstract


Launched on [Pylon Gateway](https://gateway.pylon.money/tokens/sayve/) on December 21st, 2021, Sayve is a savings and earning protocol built on the Terra Blockchain, with an AI-powered Learn to Earn mechanism. Sayve aims to onboard the next generation of crypto users by helping combat education inflation and rewarding learning.

For more details about SAYVE’s tokenomics, you can check out [our website](https://www.sayve.money/).

## Motivation

To reduce price impact and volatility for $SAYVE and ensure that our store of value is not subject to price manipulation, the SAYVE community can provide 1 billion $SAYVE as LP rewards, linearly distributed over 4 years**

## Specification

In order to grow the SAYVE-UST pool and protect the Sayve protocol’s funds, we propose a dual incentive campaign involving both $SAYVE and $ASTRO tokens.

We propose that the Astral Assembly provides rewards in line with $SAYVE pool incentives which would be equivalent (given the current $SAYVE price) to approximately 1000 ASTRO tokens per day (365,000 ASTRO per year).

The estimated dual rewards APR is shown below for various levels of liquidity.(estimated APR values assume that $SAYVE = $0.01)

| Liquidity in SAYVE-UST pool | SAYVE Rewards APR | Astro APR | Total Reward APR |
|----------------------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| $1,000,000 | 250% | 62% | 312% |
| $2,000,000 | 125% | 31% | 156% |
| $5,000,000 | 50% | 12% | 62% |
| $10,000,000 | 25% | 6% | 31% |
| $20,000,000 | 13% | 3% | 16% |
