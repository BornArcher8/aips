## Summary

Add ASTRO emissions to the MARS-UST pool.

## Abstract

Mars is emerging as a significant member of the Terra ecosystem. There are no ASTRO emissions for the MARS-UST pool, however.

## Motivation

Liquidity for the MARS-UST pool is approximately $30M, identifying it as a significant player in Astroport. MARS liquidity providers are important to the Terra ecosystem and should be provided the opportunity to earn ASTRO and to participate in governance.
This proposal would serve to establish initial emissions for the MARS-UST pool.

## Specification

Propose to give the MARS-UST pool 1% of ASTRO incentives. Alloc Points = 11000.
